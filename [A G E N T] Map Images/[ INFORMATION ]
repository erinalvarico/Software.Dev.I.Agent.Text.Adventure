The ASCI art for the map images implemented into our game [ A G E N T ] was done by my partner Joey LoRusso!
For any questions or information, contact him! (Joey LoRusso)

Currently, the map system is crudely applied to our game through pop-up window mechanics. We wish to hopefully manage to make it
visible within the same game window later after movement mechanics have been finalized.

Stay TUNED!
