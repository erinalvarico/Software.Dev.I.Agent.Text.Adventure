# Software.Dev.I.Agent.Text.Adventure
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A semester-long text based adventure game project with my partner Joey LoRusso, in Software Development I at Marist using Java in Eclipse.

Welcome to a dual collaboration or two freshman Marist computer science students!

[ A G E N T ] Is a small-scale game project that we thought of on the fly. We knew we wanted to make a video game that could capture a player's attention, so we really wanted to put a twist and make a lot of the lore and gameplay comedic. Our main theme was revolving around a secret agent-esque setting. What better way could we convey this type of plot but in a typical evil lair built within a volcano of a tropical island?

If it was up to us, we would have actually drafted the story out first prior to building it, however the project called for us to immediately dive-in without any planning of said plotline. We were also limited to some of our options:

For example we needed to have a Laboratory and Magic Shop. It's not the typical setting where a magical merchant would be found in a secret agent movie... so we had to make do with what we had! Overall, through the blood, sweat and tears, the game has finally had an ending!

So please give this short adventure a try, we hope that you'll like the comedic value as well as our efforts to make the gameplay as smooth as possible with the text-based format we chose!
